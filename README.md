## About <a name = "about"></a>

Overview:
This pokedex is a quick reference for facts and images of all your favorite pokemon.

Tools used:
This app was built using HTML5, SCSS, and JavaScript ES6 languages. After learning to create modals from scratch, I used bootstrap frameworks to create the navbar and modals. Pokemon data is drawn from the external api, https://pokeapi.co/, using AJAX. I used ESLint and Prettier to ensure my code was error-free.

Future plans:
I intend to add loading screen and searchbar functionality. I'd also like to use this app as a template for other index-type apps, such as one for drink recipes.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To open:
Clone the code and open the index.html file on your browser.

Getting started:
Click any pokemon name button to see a picture of the pokemon, as well as height, weight, and type.
